     Most of my past work has revolved around numerical methods, for which libraries and packages are very useful. For my first research projects I used <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia">julia</a>, which gave me a taste for functional programming, and I was an avid user of <a href="https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOptics.jl">QuantumOptics.jl</a> for some time.
     Then I started machine learning, and for this I first used <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl">Flux.jl</a>, which is great but lacks a lot of support for modern tools. 
     I therefore went over to python, and used <a href="https://github.com/netket/netket">netket</a>, a great <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a>-based tool developed by a F. Vicentini, a former labmate.
    Below is the list of my open source contributions.

                posteriors is the *go-to library* for uncertainty quantification of LLMs. It is functional, swappable, transformers-compatible and contains the basic important UQ methods, such as Laplace approximations, Monte-Carlo methods and variational inference. I also contributed an efficient conjugate gradient solver using fisher-vector products in pytorch, which doesn't seem to exist anywhere.

            thermox is the *best OU process simulator*, as it is exact, GPU-compatible and uses associative scans. This is used internally by us for simulation thermodynamic hardware, but can be useful for many other things (finance people contributions welcome!).
