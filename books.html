     I thought it would be a good idea to start compiling the list of books I finished reading, as it makes me write a short summary and review, as well as being able to come back to something more easily.
        <h1>Books</h1>
        
        <h2>2024</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Parcours d'un donneur de gamètes</strong><br>
                Jérome Deneubourg
                <i> This work describes the system of sperm donation in France, as perceived by the author when he tried to go through the donation procedure (which is long and painful, probably on purpose). This book is provocating and insightful, on a topic that few have considered.</i>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The brothers Karamazov</strong><br>
                Fyodor Dostoevsky
                <i>If you have never read Dostoevsky, don't start with this one, it is intense and long (start with something like The Gambler or Notes from the underground.). If you have read Dostoevsky and haven't read this one, then go ahead. I think it is his best, while being more of the genre of an odyssey and less of psychological exploration and moral dilemma. (Although it obviously contain these items!) </i>
