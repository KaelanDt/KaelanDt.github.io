     I thought it would be a good idea to start compiling the list of books I finished reading, as it makes me write a short summary and review, as well as being able to come back to something more easily.
        <h1>Books</h1>
        
        <h2>2024</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> 2024-07-08: Parcours d'un donneur de gamètes</strong><br>
                <i> Jérome Deneubourg</i><br>
                4/5. This work describes the system of sperm donation in France, as perceived by the author when he tried to go through the donation procedure (which is long and painful, probably on purpose). This book is provocating and insightful, on a topic that few have considered.
            </li>

            <li><strong> 2024-06-27: The Catcher in the Rye</strong><br>
                <i> J. D. Salinger</i><br>
                2/5. A classic of american literature, which I have to say I didn't particular find breathtaking. Belongs to the subgenre of "incel-testimony", which I usually enjoy a lot that you commonly find in Houellebecq and Dostoevsky, but this time I found it a bit too random, and couldn't really connect the dots of what was happening to Holden Caulfied. I mostly read it because my partner told me it made her cry and was one of her favourite books, clearly that's not true for me.
            </li>
            <li><strong> 2024-05-06: The brothers Karamazov</strong><br>
                <i>Fyodor Dostoevsky</i><br>
               5/5. If you have never read Dostoevsky, don't start with this one, it is intense and long (start with something like The Gambler or Notes from the underground.). If you have read Dostoevsky and haven't read this one, then go ahead. I think it is his best, while being more of the genre of an odyssey and less of psychological exploration and moral dilemma. (Although it obviously contain these items!)
