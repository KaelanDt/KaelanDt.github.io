            <h2>Bonjour!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Kaelan Donatella, and welcome to my personal website.<br><br>
                For a bit of background: I was trained in physics (because isn't it just the best field to study at university?), and worked at the intersection of quantum computing/physics and machine learning during my PhD. I was initially excited by quantum computing and in its synergy with ML before I realised that quantum computers were a bit too far ahead (10 years? 20 years?) to continue working on them. Mostly because it appeared to me that there are two paths to improve quantum computers: improve the qubit and gate quality, or improve error-correcting codes, and these things I was not particularly fond of. I then joined <a href="https://www.normalcomputing.com">Normal Computing</a> to pioneer new hardware, coined <i>thermodynamic hardware</i> whose purpose is to accelerate and optimise linear algebraic and ML workloads. That was very interesting but also perhaps a bit early for it to work (there are now more and more companies that have a similar misson, cf. Naveen Rao's Unconventional, with their massive 475M seed round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/unconventional-ai-confirms-its-massive-475m-seed-round/">massive 475M seed round</a>).
                
                Then, I decided to move up the stack a bit, and joined Lightning AI to work on model optimization and compilers.<br>
