            <p>
                I'm Kaelan Donatella, and welcome to my personal website!<br><br>
                I am a researcher in physics-based computing. Let me give a bit of background on that: I was trained in physics (because isn't it just the best field to study at university?), and worked at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning during my PhD. I then realized that quantum computers were a bit too far ahead to continue working on it, and I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.normalcomputing.com">Normal Computing</a>, which I joined to pioneer new hardware, coined <i>thermodynamic hardware.</i><br><br>
                You can find my publications <a href="publications.html">here</a>, some random thoughts and posts <a href="thoughts.html">here</a>, and a list of books that I started doing circa July 2024 <a href="books.html">here</a>.<br><br>
                Don't hesitate to write to me at kaelan -dot- donatella -at- gmail -dot- com if you want to chat about something.
